# Unnamed-Single-Double-Blower-Carbon-Filter
A carbon filter designed for Voron machines

So we all love the Nevermore, but I was unsatisfied with the mounting options for certain machines.  This filter is designed to be used in any Voron machine with single and dual blower variants.
It fits on the rear plate of a v0, rear plate of a trident/v1.8, and the deck plate of a v2.4.  The carbon basket is held in with magnets to provide enough support to mount vertically or horizontally.
